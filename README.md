# Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP) Algorithm
The Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP) Algorithm is a C++ implementation developed as part of a Data Mining course project. It is designed to efficiently mine sequential patterns from a dataset using the GSP algorithm.

## Description
The GSP algorithm is a classic sequential pattern mining algorithm used to discover patterns in sequential data, such as transaction sequences or event logs. It identifies frequent sequences of events or items in the dataset, which can then be used for various applications like market basket analysis, web log analysis, and more.

## Features
* Efficient Mining: Utilizes the GSP algorithm for efficient mining of sequential patterns.
* Console Application: Implemented as a console-based application for ease of use.
* Support Counting: Counts the support of each sequential pattern to identify frequent patterns.
* Variable Support Threshold: Allows users to set a support threshold percentage for pattern identification.

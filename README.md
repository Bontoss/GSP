# Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP) Algorithm
## Description
The Generalized Sequential Pattern (GSP) Algorithm is a C++ implementation developed for a Data Mining course project. This classic algorithm efficiently mines sequential patterns from datasets, identifying frequent sequences of events or items such as transaction sequences or event logs. These patterns are valuable for applications like market basket analysis and web log analysis.

## Features
* Efficient Mining: Utilizes the GSP algorithm for efficient mining of sequential patterns.
* Console Application: Implemented as a console-based application for ease of use.
* Support Counting: Counts the support of each sequential pattern to identify frequent patterns.
* Variable Support Threshold: Allows users to set a support threshold percentage for pattern identification.
